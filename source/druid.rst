Kafka Connect Druid
=====================

WORK IN PROGRESS NOT COMPLETE!

Prerequisites
-------------

- Confluent 3.0.1
- Java 1.8
- Scala 2.11

Setup
-----

Druid Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~

Download and start Druid.

... sourcecode:: bash



Confluent Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. sourcecode:: bash

    #make confluent home folder
    ➜  mkdir confluent

    #download confluent
    ➜  wget http://packages.confluent.io/archive/3.0/confluent-3.0.1-2.11.tar.gz

    #extract archive to confluent folder
    ➜  tar -xvf confluent-3.0.1-2.11.tar.gz -C confluent

    #setup variables
    ➜  export CONFLUENT_HOME=~/confluent/confluent-3.0.1

Enable topic deletion.

In ``/etc/kafka/server.properties`` add the following so we can delete
topics.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    delete.topic.enable=true

Start the Confluent platform.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    #Start the confluent platform, we need kafka, zookeeper and the schema registry
    bin/zookeeper-server-start etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties &
    bin/kafka-server-start etc/kafka/server.properties &
    bin/schema-registry-start etc/schema-registry/schema-registry.properties &

Build the Connector and CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The prebuilt jars can be taken from `here <https://github.com/datamountaineer/stream-reactor/releases>`__ and
`here <https://github.com/datamountaineer/kafka-connect-tools/releases>`__
or from `Maven <http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22kafka-connect-cli%22>`__

If you want to build the connector, clone the repo and build the jar.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    ##Build the connectors
    git clone https://github.com/datamountaineer/stream-reactor
    cd stream-reactor
    gradle fatJar

    ##Build the CLI for interacting with Kafka connectors
    git clone https://github.com/datamountaineer/kafka-connect-tools
    cd kafka-connect-tools
    gradle fatJar


Sink Connector QuickStart
-------------------------

Sink Connector Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next we start the connector in standalone mode. This useful for testing and one of jobs, usually you'd run in distributed
mode to get fault tolerance and better performance.

Before we can start the connector we need to setup it's configuration. In standalone mode this is done by creating a
properties file and passing this to the connector at startup. In distributed mode you can post in the configuration as
json to the Connectors HTTP endpoint. Each connector exposes a rest endpoint for stopping, starting and updating the
configuration.

Since we are in standalone mode we'll create a file called druid-sink.properties with the contents below:

... sourcecode:: bash



This configuration defines:



Starting the Sink Connector (Standalone)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we are ready to start the Druid sink Connector in standalone mode.

.. note::

    You need to add the connector to your classpath or you can create a folder in ``share/java`` of the Confluent
    install location like, kafka-connect-myconnector and the start scripts provided by Confluent will pick it up.
    The start script looks for folders beginning with kafka-connect.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    #Add the Connector to the class path
    ➜  export CLASSPATH=kafka-connect-druid-0.2-cp-3.0.1-all.jar
    #Start the connector in standalone mode, passing in two properties files, the first for the schema registry, kafka
    #and zookeeper and the second with the connector properties.
    ➜  bin/connect-standalone etc/schema-registry/connect-avro-standalone.properties druid-sink.properties

We can use the CLI to check if the connector is up but you should be able to see this in logs as-well.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    ➜ java -jar build/libs/kafka-connect-cli-0.6-all.jar get druid-sink

... sourcecode:: bash

Test Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we need to put some records it to the test_table topics. We can use the ``kafka-avro-console-producer`` to do this.

Start the producer and pass in a schema to register in the Schema Registry. The schema has a ``id`` field of type int
and a ``random_field`` of type string.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    bin/kafka-avro-console-producer \
     --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test_table \
     --property value.schema='{"type":"record","name":"myrecord","fields":[{"name":"id","type":"int"},
    {"name":"random_field", "type": "string"}]}'

Now the producer is waiting for input. Paste in the following:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    {"id": 999, "random_field": "foo"}
    {"id": 888, "random_field": "bar"}


Check for records in Druid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now check the logs of the connector you should see this

Now if we check the logs of the connector we should see 2 records being inserted to Druid:

... sourcecode:: bash

If we query Druid:

... sourcecode:: bash

Starting the Connector (Distributed)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Connectors can be deployed distributed mode. In this mode one or many connectors are started on the same or different
hosts with the same cluster id. The cluster id can be found in ``etc/schema-registry/connect-avro-distributed.properties.``

.. sourcecode:: bash

    # The group ID is a unique identifier for the set of workers that form a single Kafka Connect
    # cluster
    group.id=connect-cluster

For this quick-start we will just use one host.

Now start the connector in distributed mode, this time we only give it one properties file for the kafka, zookeeper and
schema registry configurations.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    ➜  confluent-3.0.1/bin/connect-distributed confluent-3.0.1/etc/schema-registry/connect-avro-distributed.properties

Once the connector has started lets use the kafka-connect-tools cli to post in our distributed properties file.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    ➜  java -jar build/libs/kafka-connect-cli-0.6-all.jar create druid-sink < druid-sink.properties

If you switch back to the terminal you started the Connector in you should see the Druid sink being accepted and the task starting.

Insert the records as before to have them written to druid.
